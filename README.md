# The Mission
One of the most important responsibilities a system administrator or SOC analyst have is monitoring the systems he manages. Indeed it's one thing to set them up and install software on them, but then what!? Well the next step is ensuring that the machines you provisioned as well as the services you deployed on them remain available, reliable and secure! This challenge is divided in two tasks, the first one having you research how to monitor a Linux system as well as what to look for when doing so. You will have to take note of all your findings in a text file (EX: markdown) while being as exhaustive as possible (what to monitor, how to monitor it, commands used, ...). Try to answer, but don't limit yourself to, the questions below to guide you through the research process:

What are the main area of concern when monitoring a system? (EX: CPU load, disk usage, ...)
How can you check what are the most memory intensive running processes ?
What are log files? Where can you fin them on a typical Linux system ?
How can you check who where the last connected users, what they did, when they left ?
What are the different metrics of health and performance of a system ?
How can you check the uptime of a machine ?
How can you assess the network traffic ?
The second task is meant to serve as practice and will have you, in a different file, write a report with as many relevant information (what would make sense in a report) as you can muster on a system you manage. It most preferably would be a remote machine, but it can also be your local machine as this is just practice.

IMPORTANT: Take your time when researching, it's the most important part of this challenge as you'll need to be able to find out what is happening on any given system at any given time. Whether it's the percentage of system's resources currently used, what commands are being run, who is logged in, and so on...

Final Words
There are plenty of tools out there but remember that collecting the metrics is only the first step towards an end goal, which is, to be able to keep track of the state of machines, troubleshoot them to understand errors and in the best cases prevent issues before they even happen!

One last thing, we cannot understate how important, even crucial, monitoring for servers, services and applications deployment.
